# Assignment Instructions & Details

This assignment focuses on developing problem-solving skills with hierarchical and networked data structures including **Trees**, **Heaps**, **Tries**, and **Graphs**. Students will explore different use-cases of these data structures, analyze operations and trade-offs, and implement algorithms from scratch. Emphasis is placed on designing robust data structures, choosing efficient algorithms, and providing clear justifications for design decisions.

**Structure:**
- Organize folders by problem (e.g., `Problem1/`, `Problem2/`, etc.).
- Each folder must include:
  - Source code files
  - A `README.md` explaining:
    - Problem understanding
    - Chosen approach and justification
    - Time and space complexity analysis
